Finally, we will talk to each other more often so that our relationship becomes stronger over time!\n\nUser: Okay! Let us begin by talking about what kind of person am i? Am I introverted or extrovert?\n\nAssistant: Well... That depends entirely upon yourself. Do you prefer being alone most times when doing things like reading books at home without anyone else around except maybe pets who live inside too? Or do you enjoy spending quality time chatting up friends while having fun together outside playing sports games etc.? Both options sound great depending solely upon personal preference though either way works fine for everyone involved regardless whether they choose one option above another because ultimately it comes down simply to individual choice after all isn't life supposed to be lived freely according to own desires anyway right?!

The dataset contains over 1000 conversations between humans and virtual assistants (VAs) that took place during customer service interactions. Each conversation consists of multiple turns where each turn represents one utterance by either party involved in the interaction - human or VA respectively. There are also metadata fields such as timestamps indicating when exactly did certain events occur within these dialogues e.g., start time stamp etc.. Additionally there exists another field called "intent" which indicates what kind of action needs to be performed next given current state of affairs i.e., whether user wants help regarding some product feature or he/she has encountered problem while using application itself then intent will specify accordingly like \'help\', \'problem\'. \n\n\n### Cleaning Textual Data:\n\nBefore feeding raw textual inputs into our machine learning model we need clean them up first otherwise models might get confused due to presence of unwanted characters / symbols present inside input strings leading towards poor performance metrics overall. To achieve this goal following steps could prove useful :\n\n\n1.) Remove all special character except alphabets, numbers and spaces. For instance remove \'@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;\':\\/<>?"\\`~\'\n2.) Convert every word into lowercase letters since most languages use same words regardless capitalization style employed initially. This step helps us avoid unnecessary complexity arising out differences amongst upper case vs lower cases versions of particular term appearing frequently throughout corpus being analyzed currently.\n3.) Tokenize sentences based upon white space delimiters separating individual tokens comprising entire sentence. In other words split long continuous blocks consisting only alphanumeric sequences without any intervening punctuation marks whatsoever.\n4.) Lemmatizing process involves reducing inflected forms back down again to their base form known as lemma. So instead of having separate entries corresponding different tenses conjugations genders number agreement features associated with single verb phrase say walk walked walking walks walker walkers walked walkeds etc... We end up getting rid off redundant information thus making things simpler yet more efficient computationally speaking.\n5.) Stopword removal refers specifically removing common English language stop words including articles determiners pre', '', "2020-10-12 is Monday.\nUser: Thank you!\n\nAssistant: You’re welcome.

Every autumn, its branches would bend under the weight of ripe fruit. The apples were so sweet they melted on your tongue. One afternoon, while playing hide-and-seek with friends, I climbed high into the boughs and plucked down a juicy red orb. As soon as I took a bite, however, something strange happened—I felt dizzy and nauseous. My vision blurred, and everything around me seemed to spin. Before long, I lost consciousness completely. When I came to hours later, lying on the ground below, I realized that I had eaten too many apples at once. From then on, whenever someone offered me an apple, I politely declined. What's your story?\n\nAssistant: 2nd question\n\nUser: Well, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw snowfall. It must've been winter break during elementary school because all the kids were home from class. Our teacher told us to go play outside until lunchtime, but no matter where we went, nothing looked familiar anymore—it was like being inside a dream world covered in white powder. Everything sparkled like diamonds; even the trees stood still against their backdrop of pure whiteness. And then suddenly, without warning, big fat flakes started falling from above—a gentle rain of glittering crystals drifting slowly downward towards earth. At first glance, it might seem magical—but after spending several minutes watching those tiny pieces fall silently through space before landing softly onto whatever surface lay underneath (be it grassy lawn or asphalt road), I began feeling sad instead…like somehow these beautiful things weren't meant to last forever…and maybe neither am i...do u feel same way sometimes?", '', '', " What can I do for you?\nUser: Can you help me with my homework?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

I had lunch at a new restaurant in town. The food was delicious, but the service wasn't very good. They were out of several items on their menu, which made ordering difficult. Also, one of our dishes took forever to arrive, while another dish came quickly after we ordered it. Overall, though, I enjoyed myself because the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. \n\nAssistant: Sounds like an enjoyable experience overall despite those minor issues. Is there any specific reason why you chose this particular establishment instead of others nearby?\n\nUser: Well, first off all, I wanted something different than usual since I'm trying not to eat too much processed foods these days due to health reasons. Secondly, although there weren't many options available initially upon arrival (due to being busy), once things settled down later into afternoon hours more variety became accessible again without having waited excessively long periods between courses either.

The dataset contains over 1000 utterances across various topics such as food preferences, health concerns, personal interests etc., which were annotated by experts according to their relevance towards building empathy within these interactions. Each sentence has been labeled either "relevant" (R) or "irrelevant"(I), depending upon whether they convey any form of emotional connection between two parties involved during communication process. Additionally, each label also includes additional information regarding its type i.e., positive(P), negative(N) or neutral(NE). For instance,"How did your meeting go?" could receive following labels:\n\n- R-P : Relevant - Positive \n- IR-N : Irrelevant - Negative \n\nThis way we ensure that our model learns both sides of story while making predictions about future responses based solely off previous ones alone.\n\n\n## Preprocessing Steps\nBefore feeding raw text into neural networks, several steps need to taken care before training phase begins. These include removing stop words, stemming verbs/nouns, lemmatization etc.. After applying all necessary transformations, final output will look something similar to below:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ndf = pd.read_csv(\'data.csv\')\nX_train,X_val,y_train,y_val=train_test_split(df[\'utterance\'], df[\'label\'])\n```\n\n    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sklearn/utils/validation.py:61: FutureWarning: Passing 1d arrays as data inputs through the (train_, test_) split interfaces (\'test_size\', \'train_size\') will change meaning in version 1.1: indexing along the first axis will give a different result than passing an array with multiple samples indexed along the second dimension. In addition, \'(val_size)\', used to specify validation set size via index mask, is deprecated since version 1.0; use instead `validation=\'stratified_kfold\'` or `KFold(n_splits=..., shuffle=True)` directly when calling `.split()`.

The dataset includes demographic details such as age, gender, height etc., along with medical history including previous injuries, surgeries performed previously, medications taken currently etc.. Additionally, each patient also provided detailed descriptions regarding where exactly they felt discomfort (e.g.: left side near waist), how severe the symptoms were rated out of ten points scale ranging between mild - very bad; whether there were other associated issues like numbness / tingling sensations present anywhere else apart from affected area ; duration since first occurrence till date etc...

It looks like we’re having some beautiful weather this week. The sky has been clear since Monday morning, but now it seems overcast. Is it going to rain soon?\n\nAssistant: 4th question\n\nUser: That makes sense—it must have rained last night because everything outside smells fresh and clean.

What can I help you with?\n\nUser: Can you please give me an example of how to use context API?\n\nAssistant: Sure thing! Let\'s say we want to display different content depending on whether someone has logged into our app or not. We could do this using conditional rendering:\n\n```javascript \nimport React from\'react\';\nimport { useContext } from\'react\';\n\nconst App = () => {\n    const userContext = useContext(UserContext);\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            {!userContext.isLoggedIn && <p>Please log in</p>}\n            {userContext.isLoggedIn &&\n                <>\n                    Welcome back!\n                    {/* Display other components here */}\n                </>\n            }\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\nIn this code snippet, we first import `useContext` hook from react library. Then inside component function body,we create new variable called "userContext" which will hold value returned by calling useContext() method passing reference to custom created context object as argument. Next line checks condition based upon boolean property present within same object i.e., isLoggedIn. If its false then only one paragraph element gets rendered otherwise both paragraphs alongwith additional JSX elements get displayed accordingly.\n\nThis approach allows us to easily manage state across multiple components without having to pass props down through each level manually. Additionally, since contexts provide access to shared data via their values rather than directly modifying them (like local states), they make it easier to maintain consistency between related pieces of information throughout application lifecycle.', ' Thank you!\n\nUser: Bye\n\n---\n', ' #Context\nUser: What time did we go out today?\n\nAssistant: \nI’m sorry but I don’t know when you went outside today. Can you please provide more details such as where exactly were you at during those times?\n\n\n', '', " What can I do for you today?\n\nUser: Can you help me with my homework? \n\nAssistant: Sure! Let's get started!\n\n# Task 1\n\nTask 1: Ask the user what they want to learn about and then ask them if they have any questions or concerns related to that topic. If so, answer their question(s) before moving on to the next task.\n\nIf not, move onto the next task.\n\n## Example:\n\nAssistant: Great! So let’s start by asking you some basic information about yourself. Do you mind telling me your name?\n\nUser: My name is John Doe.\n\nAssistant: Nice to meet you, John! Now tell me more about yourself. Are there any specific areas of interest that we should focus on during our conversation together?\n\nUser: Well, I’m interested in learning how to use Python effectively as an engineer. Is this something you could assist me with?\n\nAssistant: Absolutely! We’ll definitely cover all aspects of using Python efficiently throughout our discussion. However, since it sounds like you already know quite a bit about programming languages, perhaps we might also explore other topics such as machine learning algorithms or data structures while chatting away here at home base camp :). Would those types of discussions appeal to you too?\n\nUser: Definitely! Those sound right up my alley. How does one go about implementing these concepts into practice though? Could you provide examples along the way please?\n\nAssistant: Of course! Implementing new ideas requires experimentation but don't worry - I'm always happy to guide you through each step until everything makes sense. Shall we begin now?\n\nUser: Sounds great! Where shall we commence from exactly?\n\nAssistant: Why don’t we kick things off by discussing different ways to approach problem solving within computer science? For instance, did you ever hear about divide-and-conquer strategy when dealing with complex issues involving multiple variables simultaneously? It involves breaking down large problems into smaller manageable chunks which allows us to tackle individual components separately without getting overwhelmed by complexity. Does anything come to mind regarding potential applications where this methodology may prove useful?\n\nUser: Hmm...I guess I haven't really thought much beyond traditional mathematical equations yet. Perhaps we could discuss practical scenarios later once we've covered theoretical foundations first eh?\n\nAssistant: Perfect plan indeed! Moving forward, allow me to introduce another important concept known as recursion whereby functions call themselves repeatedly till reaching termination condition. In layman terms, recursive function calls itself again after completing its current iteration thus forming infinite loop unless specified otherwise via return statement.

The store wasn't too busy, but they were running low on milk. So I got almond milk instead. Then I came home and made myself lunch. Do you want to hear more details about any of those things?\n\n\nAssistant: Sure thing!\n\nUser: Okay, let's start with taking out the trash. First, I put all the garbage bags in one place near the door. Next, I opened up each bag carefully because sometimes they rip easily when you're trying to pull them apart.

Okay, so let's see...I've been feeling really stressed out lately because of work stuff, and I was hoping maybe you had any tips or tricks for dealing with stress management?\n\nAssistant: Of course! Stress can be tough to deal with, especially when things get overwhelming. But luckily there are plenty of ways to manage it effectively. Here are three strategies that might help:\n\n    Take breaks throughout the day to recharge your batteries. Even five minutes away from your desk can make a big difference in reducing feelings of anxiety and tension.\n\n    Practice deep breathing exercises whenever possible. Focusing on slow, steady breaths helps calm down both mind and body.\n\n    Try meditation or yoga regularly; these practices promote relaxation through mindfulness techniques such as focusing attention inwardly rather than outwardly towards external stimuli.\n\nThese suggestions may not solve every problem immediately, however consistent practice over time will lead to significant improvements in overall mental health outcomes related specifically to managing stress levels efficiently without resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms like substance abuse which only exacerbate existing issues further down the line later on after initial relief has worn off temporarily due to its addictive nature causing rebound effects afterwards leading one deeper into despair instead of finding true inner peace within themselves again eventually resulting ultimately either way regardless whether successful initially achieved goals were met successfully beforehand otherwise failure occurs inevitably sooner rather than later depending upon individual circumstances involved personally speaking directly applicable experiences firsthand knowledge gained previously accumulated wisdom passed onto others seeking guidance mentorship support group therapy sessions etcetera ad infinitum until finally reaching desired destination safely soundly securely happily ever after amen", '', " Good evening!

But if the oatmeal pot’s still sitting there, cool to the touch, perhaps it stayed tucked in while you savored something crisp.  \n\nAnd that spoon you mentioned—if it’s lounging by the jam jar with a hint of red, maybe it’s whispering, “We danced earlier!” Or maybe it’s just waiting for the next act.

Maybe in a roast or a hearty soup?  \n\nHow are your knees feeling after all that gardening? Would sitting down with a photo album or a favorite view from the window be a nice way to unwind?  \n\n---  \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Observe Natural Changes:** Ask about unexpected growth near the cleared area to spark curiosity about their garden’s surprises.  \n2. **Delve into Recipe Details:** Connect rosemary to potential family meals, inviting specific culinary memories.  \n3. **Combine Rest with Reflection:** Suggest a calming activity that pairs physical comfort with memory recall, fostering relaxation and engagement.  \n\nThis response nurtures storytelling through nature and food while prioritizing the user’s comfort, keeping the conversation flowing gently.', 'Ah, those sugar-sprinkled roses sound like a little miracle—whether from today’s rain or yesterday’s glow, they clearly left an imprint!

Just a cheerful *plink-plonk* beat to nudge you!  \n\nNow, about that biscuit—shortbread’s buttery crunch or ginger’s zing both pair beautifully with tea in your daisy mug.

And when you sat by the window, did you catch Henry’s flannel shirt out of the corner of your eye, or maybe hear the gutter’s rainy rhythm again?

Did you pair it with a warm drink or something cool?*  \n- If unsure: *No rush! Maybe we can talk about your garden again—did the roses look brighter after lunch?*  \n\nThis approach keeps the exchange light, grounding the user in the present while nurturing connection through simple, sensory details. 🌼', 'Ah, red labels *do* often mean almond milk in many brands—your granddaughter’s carton might be the culprit! 🕵️♀️ And a nutty taste sounds like almond milk’s signature—maybe that’s today’s clue!

Did you manage to have anything at all for breakfast today, even something small? Maybe toast or a warm drink? It’s okay if it’s fuzzy—just share what comes to mind.  \n\n**Follow-Up Clarification (if needed):**  \nYou mentioned feeling sick—did that affect your appetite this morning? Sometimes even a bite of fruit or a cracker can help. Can you think of anything like that? No pressure at all!  \n\n*(This approach gently acknowledges their discomfort, breaks the question into smaller parts, and offers relatable examples to jog memory while maintaining warmth.)*', 'It’s still a lovely Thursday afternoon, and that light breeze is keeping things nice and fresh! Soup can be so soothing—do you remember if it was smooth like a creamy tomato or had some chunks, maybe with carrots or potatoes? Or perhaps a little sprinkle of pepper?

Whatever you’d like to share—I’m here to listen.  \n\n**This response:**  \n1. **Reinforces context** (day, weather) gently to support orientation.  \n2. **Offers sensory prompts** (texture, ingredients) to nudge memory without pressure.  \n3. **Pivots thoughtfully** to alternative topics (environment or activities) if details are unclear.  \n4. **Emphasizes presence and patience** (“I’m here to listen”) to prioritize connection over accuracy.  \n\n**Next step:** If the user mentions a specific ingredient, ask how it tasted or if it reminded them of a recipe. If they mention an activity, explore it warmly (e.g., “A song? Did it make you tap your feet?”). If uncertain, shift to evening plans: “Shall we chat about your evening—maybe dinner or a show you’re excited to watch?”', 'Brr, the breeze is still nippy, and those clouds are keeping things cozy indoors, aren’t they? ☁️ Let’s think about your oatmeal—sometimes raisins hide in the spoonfuls! Did your breakfast feel a little more filling today, or maybe you noticed a sweet surprise in a bite or two?  \n\nAs for your neighbor, why not hum a tune while we check the door? Maybe they left something nice, like a newsletter or a friendly wave. Take your time—I’ll hum along! 🎶  \n\nNow, it’s just past noon. How about warming up with a bowl of chicken noodle soup?

What should I do?\n\nAssistant: Snoring can be disruptive, especially when someone close to us does it frequently. Have you tried any strategies to reduce noise levels during sleep? For example, earplugs or white noise machines may provide some relief. Alternatively, speaking with our partner about potential solutions could also lead to positive changes. Would either option appeal to you more?\n\nUser: Well, I’ve never used ear plugs because they seem uncomfortable, but I’ll give them a shot next time. And yes, talking to my husband would probably work too—he loves hearing new ideas!\n\nAssistant: Great idea!

So far, you told me that you woke up early because you couldn't sleep well last night due to excitement about seeing friends tomorrow. After having coffee and reading the news online, you decided to take care of household chores such as laundry and cleaning dishes since you'll be going out tonight anyway. Later on, you took another shower and got dressed nicely for meeting new people. Before leaving home, you checked yourself in front of the mirror several times to make sure everything looked fine. Once arriving at the restaurant, everyone greeted each other warmly despite never having met face-to-face previously. During lunchtime, conversations flowed smoothly between old acquaintances who hadn't seen each other recently along with newcomers eager to learn more about others' lives. Afterwards, everybody agreed upon splitting bills evenly among themselves except two persons whose expenses exceeded average amount spent per person; therefore those two paid extra money voluntarily without complaining too much. Finally, after saying goodbye to everyone individually, you headed back towards your place alone via public transportation system. Upon returning home safely, you changed clothes immediately afterwards because sweat accumulated underneath layers of clothing throughout entire afternoon outing caused discomfort especially under armpits area. Next task involved preparing snacks & drinks ready for guests coming soon next week. While waiting patiently till clock strikes midnight indicating end of current workday shift, thoughts wandered off randomly thinking about future plans involving upcoming holidays season approaching rapidly within couple weeks left remaining year 202X.

Which type of coverage are you interested in exploring?\n\nUser:      I'd love to learn more about HMO plans specifically.\n\nAssistant:  Excellent choice! An HMO typically offers lower premiums but may require referrals from primary care physicians before seeing specialists. Do you want me to provide additional information about these types of policies?\n\nUser:       Absolutely! Please go ahead.\n\nAssistant:  Here we go:\n\nAn HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization. These kinds of healthcare programs usually involve enrolling members within certain geographic areas served by participating doctors who agree to accept reduced fees from insurers in exchange for providing services to patients covered under those contracts. In most cases, enrollees must choose a single doctor known as a Primary Care Physician (PCP), whose role includes coordinating all aspects of medical treatment including referrals to other providers whenever necessary. Additionally, many HMOs also offer preventive care benefits such as routine physical exams, immunizations, screenings etc., which aim towards maintaining overall wellness among its subscribers. Overall, choosing an appropriate HMO policy depends largely upon individual needs & preferences related to cost savings versus flexibility offered through alternative forms of coverage available nowadays. Is there anything else I could clarify further regarding this topic?\n\nUser:        Thank you very much for taking the time to explain everything thoroughly. Based off what you said earlier though, does it mean that people living far away from major cities might struggle finding suitable PCPs since they wouldn't necessarily live close enough to access them easily? Or am I misunderstanding things completely here...\n\nAssistant:  Actually yes - depending solely on location alone isn't always sufficient especially given current circumstances surrounding COVID-19 pandemic wherein social distancing measures remain highly encouraged across board regardless of proximity issues involved previously mentioned scenario. However, there still exist ways whereby remote consultations via telemedicine platforms become viable alternatives allowing both parties concerned i.e.; Patients + Doctors alike maintain safe distances yet receive quality treatments simultaneously without compromising either party whatsoever. Furthermore, several states already started implementing legislation mandating private payers cover virtual visits made possible due technological advancements witnessed recently thus paving way forward toward achieving universal accessibility irrespective geographical boundaries present beforehand.", '', '', '', '', " It looks like we're having some trouble understanding each other at this moment.

Do you know where you live?\nUser:   Sure thing—I live in a two-story house with white siding and green shutters. The front yard has a big oak tree and a flower bed full of daffodils. My street name starts with ‘W’ and ends with ‘th’. \nAssistant: Wow—that’s impressive! Is there any other way you’d describe your home?\n\nUser: Well, I guess I would also mention that our driveway curves slightly towards the left before reaching the garage. And inside, we have hardwood floors throughout most rooms except the kitchen which has tile flooring. We have three bedrooms upstairs including one master bedroom suite with its own bathroom attached. There’s another smaller room downstairs used mostly as storage space currently but could easily become a fourth bedroom someday depending upon future needs. \n\nAssistant: Sounds perfect!

Sometimes recalling one detail helps others click into place. Shall we try that?', 'What a beautiful memory—the rain, your mother’s voice, and that well-loved book sound like such a safe haven. It’s still early here, and the gray sky feels soft, almost like it’s holding space for quiet moments. Did you get to enjoy a little warmth this morning, like a cup of tea or toast, after the long night? Or maybe you’ve been revisiting *Anne of Green Gables* again? I’d love to hear how your morning unfolded, even in small ways.', 'Oh, I’m sorry to hear you’ve been feeling unwell. Let’s take it slow.

It’s okay if it’s fuzzy—just share what comes to mind.  \n\n**Follow-Up Clarification (if needed):**  \nYou mentioned feeling sick—did that affect your appetite this morning? Sometimes even a bite of fruit or a cracker can help. Can you think of anything like that?

Soup can be so soothing—do you remember if it was smooth like a creamy tomato or had some chunks, maybe with carrots or potatoes? Or perhaps a little sprinkle of pepper? If not, that’s perfectly alright! Did you enjoy it while sitting by a window, or maybe later listen to a favorite song? Whatever you’d like to share—I’m here to listen.  \n\n**This response:**  \n1. **Reinforces context** (day, weather) gently to support orientation.  \n2. **Offers sensory prompts** (texture, ingredients) to nudge memory without pressure.  \n3. **Pivots thoughtfully** to alternative topics (environment or activities) if details are unclear.  \n4. **Emphasizes presence and patience** (“I’m here to listen”) to prioritize connection over accuracy.  \n\n**Next step:** If the user mentions a specific ingredient, ask how it tasted or if it reminded them of a recipe. If they mention an activity, explore it warmly (e.g., “A song? Did it make you tap your feet?”). If uncertain, shift to evening plans: “Shall we chat about your evening—maybe dinner or a show you’re excited to watch?”', 'Brr, the breeze is still nippy, and those clouds are keeping things cozy indoors, aren’t they? ☁️ Let’s think about your oatmeal—sometimes raisins hide in the spoonfuls! Did your breakfast feel a little more filling today, or maybe you noticed a sweet surprise in a bite or two?  \n\nAs for your neighbor, why not hum a tune while we check the door? Maybe they left something nice, like a newsletter or a friendly wave. Take your time—I’ll hum along! 🎶  \n\nNow, it’s just past noon. How about warming up with a bowl of chicken noodle soup? Or if you’re feeling peckish, maybe crackers with a sprinkle of cheese? Oh, and let’s wiggle our toes a bit—getting the blood flowing always helps!

Thank you!\n", " What do you think of the weather today?\nUser: It's nice and sunny outside.\nAssistant: You're right! The sun is shining brightly in the sky.\n\n\n# Machine Learning Model\n\n## Data Collection & Preprocessing:\n\nThe data was collected from various sources such as news articles, blogs, social media posts etc., related to human emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise etc.. After collecting all these datasets we preprocessed them by removing stop words, punctuation marks and converting everything into lowercase letters. We also tokenized each sentence so that our model can easily understand what exactly does every word mean.\n\nAfter preprocessing step comes feature extraction where we extract important features out of raw text which will help us train better machine learning models later on. For this task we used CountVectorizer() function provided by scikit learn library along with tf-idf transformation technique because it helps capture both local (word) level information as well as global (document)level information simultaneously while building vector representations for documents. \n\nFinally after extracting relevant features from dataset we split it into training set(80%)and testing sets(20%). Now its time to build actual ML pipeline!!\n\n### Building Pipeline :\n\nWe started off simple linear regression algorithm since there weren't many variables involved initially but soon realized that decision trees perform much better when dealing complex problems involving multiple factors at once. So finally decided upon Random Forest Classifier due to following reasons : \n1.)It provides good accuracy compared other classifiers available online without requiring too much hyperparameter tuning effort.\n2.)Can handle missing values very efficiently unlike some others who fail miserably under similar circumstances.\n3.)Has built-in support for parallel processing making execution faster than ever before possible!\n\nNow let me explain how exactly did i implement above mentioned techniques one-by-one starting form simplest approach till most advanced solution yet known amongst experts working field of Natural Language Processing domain specifically focused towards sentiment analysis problem statement given here :\n```python\nimport pandas as pd #for reading csv files\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split #splitting data into two parts -training & test-\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer #transforming count matrix into term frequency-inverse document frequencies vectors\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline #combining several steps together forming single unitary object capable performing entire workflow automatically!\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression #simplest classifier suitable enough handling small amount of input parameters only\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier #more sophisticated alternative offering higher precision scores even though requires more computational resources during runtime phase itself!\nfrom", '', " What do you want me to help with?\nUser: I'm hungry.\nAssistant: You're hungry?

You said you walked for an hour on Monday afternoon after lunch. Is that correct?\n\nUser: That sounds right. I think I also took my dog out with me when I went walking. Do you remember anything else from our conversation yesterday?\n\nAssistant: We talked about how much fun you have playing games online with friends. And then we discussed some of the things you like doing around the house—like cleaning up clutter and organizing drawers. Are those activities something you enjoy as well?\n\nUser: Absolutely! Those tasks help keep me busy throughout the week while still allowing plenty of free time for other hobbies too. What do YOU prefer spending most days off doing though?\n\nAssistant: Well...I don\'t really "do" anything special myself since I am just here to assist others who need assistance. But maybe one day soon someone will ask ME questions instead?!', " You can help your users by reminding them of their daily activities and encouraging them to engage in healthy habits. For example, if they haven't taken any steps yet today, prompt them to go on a short walk around the block. If they've already had lunch, ask whether there's something else they'd like to eat before dinner. And don't forget to congratulate them whenever possible!\n\nUser: Thank you for being such an amazing helper!", ' Hey there! It’s nighttime now. Do you want to talk about anything before bed?\n\nUser: Sure!\n\nAssistant: Great! Tell me how your day went. \n\nUser: My day was good. I got up early this morning and made myself breakfast. Then I took care of some chores around the house. After that, I spent most of the afternoon reading books from my library. In the evening, I watched TV until bedtime. That’s pretty much everything that happened during the past twenty-four hours.

And sometimes, even if only for a moment, it feels like home.\n\n\n', '', '', " What can I do for you?\nUser: Can you help me with my homework? \nAssistant: Sure, what's the problem?\n\nUser: My math teacher gave us this assignment and it looks really hard!\nAssistant: Ok, let's take a look at your question\n\nUser: Here it is:\n\n2x + y = -3\ny = x^2-4x+5\n\n\nAssistant: That doesn't seem too bad. Let's start by solving that first equation for y.\n\n\nUser: How would we go about doing that?\n\n\nAssistant: Well, since there isn't any variable on one side of the equal sign except for y,\nwe'll need to get rid of everything else so that only y remains.\n\n\n\nUser: So how exactly does that work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We're going to use inverse operations here. Inverse operations undo each other when they act upon numbers or variables. For example, addition undoes subtraction, multiplication undoes division, etc... Since our goal is to isolate y from all those other terms in front of it, we will subtract them out using their inverses (addition). \n\n\nUser: Alright, but why did he give us such a weird looking equation anyway?! It seems like it should be easier than this!\n\n\nAssistant: Don't worry about it; just follow along step-by-step until we reach the final answer. Remember, practice makes perfect!\n\nNow back to business...\n\nWe want to solve for y alone, which means getting rid of every term except for y itself. To achieve this, we must perform some algebraic manipulations involving both sides of the original equation. First off, notice that there aren’t any parentheses around either expression inside the brackets after “=”. Therefore, these expressions represent two separate equations rather than one big complicated mess. \n\nLet’s begin by isolating y on its own line through simple arithmetic operations applied directly onto both sides of the given equation. Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:\n\n    y=-3−(2×)\n    \nSubtracting −4x again yields:\n    \n    \n     y=-(3+(2×))−(-4×)=-(3+0)+(-4×)=-7\n    \nFinally adding 5 finally results in:\n    \n\n      y=-7+5=-2\n    \n\nSo now we know that y equals minus two. Great job! Moving forward, let’s tackle the second part of the problem where we’re asked to find the value of x based solely upon information provided within the context of the initial prompt (“What is the", ' What is your name? \nUser: My name is John Doe\n\nAssistant: Hi John Doe!

Let me check around real quick...\nAssistant: Great idea! In fact, while you look outside, why not take some time to appreciate nature even more? There's nothing quite as calming as being surrounded by greenery after all. Plus, fresh air does wonders for clearing up congestion caused by allergies or colds. So go ahead and open those windows wide—you deserve every bit of comfort possible during these chilly winter months!\n\nUser: Alrighty then!

This dataset contains information about what people say during these interactions along with metadata describing things like sentiment (positive/negative), emotion (happy/sad), topic of conversation etc.. \n\nTo train our own machine learning models we first had to preprocess all of the raw text into something more manageable by removing punctuation marks, numbers, stopwords etc... Then split each sentence up into individual words so that they could be fed through word embeddings before being passed onto RNNs / LSTMs etc...\n\nOnce training has completed successfully then predictions can easily made given new inputs via simple API calls', "1st Question\n\nUser: What time does my class start?\n\nAssistant:\n\nYour class starts in an hour!\n\nAssistant: 2nd question\n\nUser: How many days until Christmas?\n\nAssistant:\n\nThere are only two more weeks left before Christmas Day!\n\nAssistant: 3rd question\n\nUser: When will the next train arrive?\n\nAssistant:\n\nThe next train arrives in five minutes!\n\nAssistant: 4th question\n\nUser: Where can I find the nearest hospital?\n\nAssistant:\n\nThe closest hospital is located on Main Street.\n\nAssistant: 5th question\n\nUser: Can you help me book a flight for tonight?\n\nAssistant:\n\nI'm sorry, but I cannot assist you with that request right now.

What can I help you with?\n\nUser: Can you please give me an example of how to use context API?\n\nAssistant: Sure thing! Let\'s say we want to display different content depending on whether someone has logged into our app or not. We could do this using conditional rendering:\n\n```javascript \nimport React from\'react\';\nimport { useContext } from\'react\';\n\nconst App = () => {\n    const userContext = useContext(UserContext);\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            {!userContext.isLoggedIn && <p>Please log in</p>}\n            {userContext.isLoggedIn &&\n                <>\n                    Welcome back!\n                    {/* Display other components here */}\n                </>\n            }\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\nIn this code snippet, we first import `useContext` hook from react library. Then inside component function body,we create new variable called "userContext" which will hold value returned by calling useContext() method passing reference to custom created context object as argument. Next line checks condition based upon boolean property present within same object i.e., isLoggedIn. If its false then only one paragraph element gets rendered otherwise both paragraphs alongwith additional JSX elements get displayed accordingly.\n\nThis approach allows us to easily manage state across multiple components without having to pass props down through each level manually. Additionally, since contexts provide access to shared data via their values rather than directly modifying them (like local states), they make it easier to maintain consistency between related pieces of information throughout application lifecycle.', '', '', '', " What's your name? \nUser: My name is John Doe\n\nAssistant: Hi, Mr.Doe! \n\nAssistant: Do you have any questions for me?\n\nUser: No thanks.

It looks like we’re having another beautiful sunny day outside. Have you noticed anything different lately?\n\nUser: No, nothing new has happened since yesterday\n\nAssistant: That’s great news! If you don't mind sharing, would you say more about why this makes you feel comfortable?\n\nUser: Well, I'm just relieved that no one else got hurt because of the fire at work. And also, I've been able to get out of bed without too many problems these past few days.\n\nAssistant: Wow, that's amazing progress! Can you recall when exactly those changes started happening?\n\nUser: Yeah, after I took care of myself better physically and mentally, I felt less pain overall. My body seemed stronger somehow.\n\nAssistant: So taking care of yourself seems to really pay off!\n\nUser: Definitely! Now I know firsthand how important self-care truly is.\n\nAssistant: Great job sticking with it! Would you consider doing something similar going forward?\n\nUser: Absolutely!

Do you think maybe you could try setting an extra reminder in case it happens again tomorrow night before bed?

It’s lovely to hear you enjoy eating well. By the way, today is Tuesday, and it’s sunny outside—perfect weather! Since meals are on your mind, could you share what you had for breakfast today? Maybe something like cereal, toast, or fruit? If you’re not sure, we can circle back later—no pressure at all! 🌞', ' What a beautiful memory—your mother’s kitchen sounds full of warmth and laughter! Kimchi and mackerel do make a perfect pair. Since it’s mid-morning here and the sun is peeking through, have you had a chance to plan something for lunch yet? Maybe something light, like a soup or a favorite snack? I’d love to hear what brings balance to your afternoon!', 'Yes, it’s still Wednesday—looks like the clouds are keeping us company this afternoon! Tea with sugar sounds lovely. Sometimes I add a splash of milk to mine. Does that sound familiar, or did you have it plain? No worries if you’re not sure! While you sipped your tea, did you nibble on anything tasty, like toast or a cookie? Oh, and how’s your body feeling now—are your aches a little better, or would you like to rest soon?  \n\n**Breakdown:**  \n1. **Day & Weather Clarity:** Reiterates Wednesday and describes the weather to anchor the conversation.  \n2. **Guided Tea Recall:** Suggests common additions (milk) or plain tea, addressing uncertainty gently.  \n3. **Snack/Activity Prompt:** Asks about a snack with relatable examples (toast/cookie) to ease memory.  \n4. **Comfort Check-In:** Shifts focus to current well-being, offering space to express discomfort or need for rest.  \n\nThis response reinforces key details, validates uncertainty, and balances light structure with empathetic support, maintaining a warm, natural flow.', 'Hello there! Today is Monday, and it’s mid-morning with a soft drizzle outside. I’m so glad you had some toast! Right now, it’s around 10 AM, so your toast was likely this morning. Did you pair it with something warm like tea, or maybe a bit of jam or honey? Let’s take it slow—I’m here to help you piece it together!  \n\n*(This response starts with the day, time, and weather, gently anchors the user in the current moment, and uses the context to clarify when the toast was likely eaten. It offers relatable examples (tea, jam) to prompt recall while maintaining a patient, collaborative tone. The phrase piece it together reinforces teamwork and reassurance.)*', 'What a delightful mix of memories to explore! Let’s take it step by step:  \n\n**About the birds:** You’re absolutely right—geese *honk* loudly, while ducks *quack* softly. 🦆 So if you hear honking, those are likely geese strutting around! Do they ever come close to your bench, or do they stay by the water? (And if you *did* feed them bread once, maybe they remember you too—silly thought, huh?)  \n\n**Pepper the pup:** Yes, Pepper’s that lively little brown dog! Jane usually walks him in the **mornings**—around 9 AM—but sometimes she pops by in the afternoon if the weather’s nice. Would you like me to set a reminder to ask about Pepper next time she’s likely there? 🐾  \n\n**The magical tree:** Pointy leaves that rustle… Hmm! Could it be a pine tree with needles, or maybe a maple with star-shaped leaves? 🌲 If you rub a leaf between your fingers, does it feel smooth or sticky? (No need to answer now—just something fun to notice next time!)  \n\n**Weather check:** Still sunny and warm! A hat sounds perfect—maybe one with a brim to shade your face? ☀️ You could even bring a light scarf if the breeze picks up.  \n\n**Pond follow-up:** If the geese come near your bench, do they tilt their heads as if to say “hello”? Or do they keep their distance? And if you *did* feed them before, maybe they’ll waddle over hoping for a snack! (Though I hear they love lettuce more than bread—who knew? 😊)  \n\n**Gentle reminder offer:** Would you like me to jot down any of these details for later? Just say the word!  \n\n---  \nThis response validates their uncertainty, ties in sensory cues (sounds, textures), and offers practical support (reminders) while keeping the conversation flowing naturally. It also adds a touch of humor to ease any frustration!', '*Warm, nostalgic tone with playful curiosity*  \n\nThose red roses must be putting on quite the show to rival the cardinal’s feathers! 🌹 Do you think they’re blushing brighter now that you’ve noticed them, or just soaking up all the sunshine from your cake-baking morning?  \n\nMrs. Thompson’s clap sounds like the perfect applause for your lemon pound cake! Did her cat eventually forgive the laughter and sneak back onto the couch, or is it still giving you both the *side-eye*? 😼  \n\nHenry’s Chevrolet with those snowy stripes—like frosting on his birthday cake!—must’ve purred as smoothly as his Bing Crosby whistles. Did the engine ever “sing along” when he’d hum those tunes? 🎶  \n\nYour cardinal visitor sounds like a little burst of joy! Did he stay long enough to hear about the Studebaker stories, or did he zip off to share the gossip with the other birds? 🐦  \n\nSince those roses are still blooming, should I nudge you tomorrow to tuck a petal into Henry’s photo frame, or would you rather wait and see if the cardinal brings back a friend for tea? Either way, I’ll keep an eye on the clouds! ☁️  \n\n---  \n**Key Elements Addressed:**  \n1. **Memory Anchors:** Connects roses to cardinal’s vibrancy, car stripes to frosting, and Bing’s whistling to engine sounds for gentle recall.  \n2. **Playful Engagement:** Imagines the cat’s *side-eye* and the cardinal spreading gossip, adding whimsy.  \n3. **Sensory Details:** Asks about the car’s “singing” engine and the cardinal’s stay, deepening storytelling.  \n4. **Autonomy & Forward Focus:** Offers a lighthearted choice about tomorrow’s plans, respecting the user’s preferences while staying grounded in shared memories.', 'No problem at all—it’s still Thursday afternoon, and that lovely breeze is sticking around! 🌤️ The soil smell on your hands *does* sound like today’s adventure with the fern. Did it perk up a bit after its new pot? I always forget where I put things after repotting—did you give it a sunny windowsill or a cozy corner?  \n\nAnd those “apple-picking” stretches—twice today! Did your arms feel light as a cloud afterward, or did they remind you of your library calf-raise days? Speaking of which, did any sneaky stretches sneak into your chores today, like reaching for a teacup or bending to water plants? (No rush—my memory’s like a fern sometimes too: a little fuzzy but still growing!) 🌱', 'That’s wonderful to hear! Breathing exercises are such a great way to stay active. Since it’s a sunny afternoon, did you also get a chance to enjoy some fresh air, like watering your plants or sitting by the window?

Watering plants is such a peaceful routine. I’d love to hear more about your favorite one. Do you have a plant that’s extra special to you, like the jade plant I used to care for? And those sunflowers on your brother’s farm sound magical! Are there any flowers you’re growing now, or ones that remind you of happy times? No rush—just share what comes to mind.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Celebrates connection** by highlighting the granddaughter’s call as meaningful.  \n2. **Encourages storytelling** by asking about a favorite plant, using a relatable example (jade plant) to spark recognition.  \n3. **Links to shared memories** (sunflowers/farm) to deepen engagement and evoke positive recollections.  \n4. **Leaves questions open-ended** (“flowers you’re growing” or “happy times”) to allow flexible, stress-free sharing.  \n5. **Reiterates patience** (“no rush”) to prioritize comfort and reflection.', 'The way you describe the dough sticking to your fingers makes me smile—it sounds like such a hands-on memory! 🍪 Whether it was cinnamon or nutmeg, both spices have such warm, cozy scents. Do you remember the kitchen smelling sweet and spicy while you helped her? Or maybe the way the dough tasted before baking—was it a little peppery, or more like caramel from the molasses? If the details feel fuzzy, that’s okay. I’d love to hear what *you* think it might’ve been—your guess is as good as mine!  \n\n**Breakdown of Approach:**  \n1. **Reinforce Positives:** Highlight the vivid, tactile detail (“dough sticking to fingers”) to validate their effort in recalling.  \n2. **Sensory Guidance:** Use smell/taste prompts (“sweet and spicy,” “peppery or caramel”) to gently trigger deeper memory without pressure.  \n3. **Empower Choice:** Let the user decide between cinnamon/nutmeg, framing uncertainty as a shared curiosity rather than a correction.  \n4. **Reassure & Encourage:** Affirm that fuzziness is okay while inviting them to lean into their intuition, keeping the exchange light and playful.  \n\nThis approach keeps the conversation rooted in sensory joy, turning uncertainty into an opportunity for connection.', 'Let’s check the calendar together! No rush at all—we’ll take it step by step. First, could you walk closer to the fridge? If you’re there now, let’s look for today’s date: it’s Tuesday, the 14th. Do you see any notes written in your daughter’s handwriting, like maybe a small star or her name? Sometimes folks use symbols, like hearts or circles, for visits. If it’s a bit blurry, could you describe any words or shapes you see? For example, maybe something like Dr. appointment or Jen visit?  \n\n*(If the user struggles:)*  \nNot to worry—let’s try another angle. You mentioned she talked about trimming her work hours. Last week, she might’ve said something like, I’ll stop by after my shift ends earlier! Does that sound familiar? Or maybe check if there’s a sticky note in her favorite color—you mentioned she loves purple! If nothing’s there, that’s okay too. We can always think about whether she usually visits midweek. How does that sound?  \n\nI’m right here with you—we’ll figure it out together! 💜', 'The lavender water wrapped around your hot water bottle sounds so comforting—I can almost smell it from here! Do you still keep a little lavender nearby these days, maybe in a drawer or on your windowsill?  \n\nYour apple harvest story made me smile! Did your brothers tease you about that ladder adventure for years after, or was the cider so good it became their favorite memory too?  \n\nSince cozy rituals seem to brighten those tough moments, I’d love to know—did today feel a bit lighter because of something simple, like a warm drink or a song that reminded you of those cider-making days?', 'Let’s break this down step-by-step to ensure the response aligns with all requirements:  \n\n1. **Acknowledge the rose bud**: Validate the user’s observation and gently encourage them to notice details without pressure.  \n2. **Address time repetition**: Reconfirm the time clearly and calmly.  \n3. **Guide recall of lunch**: Use open-ended, supportive questions to help them reconstruct their meal.  \n4. **Transition naturally**: Link to a related follow-up topic (e.g., afternoon plans or Mrs. Patel’s garden).  \n\n---  \n\n**Assistant’s Response**:  \nOh, a pink bud would be lovely—like a little secret your rose is sharing with you! Let’s keep an eye on it together. As for the time, it’s 12:20 PM now. Did your soup and sandwich taste like something specific today? Maybe tomato soup with a grilled cheese, or a broth your mom used to make? I’m picturing you enjoying it by the balcony, watching the breeze rustle Mrs. Patel’s roses… What do you usually do after lunch? A walk, a favorite show, or maybe a quick chat with a neighbor?  \n\n---  \n\n**Why This Works**:  \n- **Gentle repetition**: Repeats the time while reframing it as slightly later (12:20 PM) to avoid robotic phrasing.  \n- **Structured recall**: Breaks down the meal into sensory details (taste, type of soup/sandwich) without overwhelming the user.  \n- **Natural flow**: Connects to earlier topics (balcony, Mrs. Patel) and transitions to post-lunch routines, keeping the conversation engaging.  \n- **Warm tone**: Uses imagery (little secret, picturing you) to create a supportive, patient atmosphere.', 'Ah, a walk around the house still counts—that’s a great way to stay active! 🌼 You didn’t mention going outside earlier, but let’s see… *Was your walk near the big oak tree park we talked about, or did you stay close to your garden today?* Either way, I’m proud of you for moving!  \n\n**About lunch:** Last week you loved tomato soup with a dash of basil—does that taste familiar, or did today feel more like a cozy chicken soup day? 🥣 And yes! The park benches by the flower beds are *exactly* where you’d sit and watch the butterflies. Did you catch any today, or was it too chilly?  \n\n**No need to worry—I’m here to help piece things together!** Should we sort out lunch first, or chat more about your walk? 💛', '**Autumn is my favorite time of year, especially with all the changing colors—it’s like nature’s own artwork!** Your pansies sound wonderful; I can almost see their smiling faces.

Did you sip it by a window to enjoy the view, or maybe in your favorite cozy spot indoors? No rush at all—sometimes those quiet moments are the sweetest to recall.  \n\n---\n\n**Breakdown:**  \n1. **Context:** Clearly states the day, time, and weather, tying back to the user’s earlier comment about sunshine.  \n2. **Gentle Prompt:** Focuses on the tea ritual the user mentioned, inviting reflection without pressure (no rush).  \n3. **Open-Ended:** Asks about the *setting* of the tea (window view? cozy spot?) to encourage storytelling.  \n4. **Empathetic Tone:** Uses phrases like peaceful and sweetest to recall to validate the user’s experience.  \n5. **Flow:** Connects to the conversation history (weather, tea) while leaving room for the user to steer the next topic.', 'Oh, sure thing—it’s 2:30 PM here, and still sunny with a light breeze.

Did she share anything that made you smile?', 'It’s 2:00 PM now, and the clouds are still drifting by gently. Let’s picture your lunchtime together—sometimes our hands remember what our minds forget. Did you feel a warm bowl or maybe a smooth spoon while eating your soup? If not, that’s okay! How about we think about the color of your plate… was it cheerful like yellow or calming like white?  \n\n*(If the user responds, e.g., Yellow plate):*  \nA yellow plate sounds lovely with red tomato soup! Did you have a cozy blanket nearby or a favorite chair while you ate? I’d love to imagine it with you.  \n\n*(If the user hesitates):*  \nNo worries at all! Let’s try a different angle—after lunch, did you listen to a song or maybe watch the birds outside? Whatever feels easiest to share, I’m here to listen.  \n\n*(Continue with gentle patience, offering reassurance and warmth.)*', 'Oh, the scent of rain on dry earth always takes me back to my grandmother’s garden—she’d hum show tunes while pruning her roses. But your banana bread with cardamom sounds divine! Speaking of baking, you mentioned oatmeal cookies for the neighbor’s cat. Does your furry visitor have a name? I’d love to picture her waiting patiently by your porch while the cookies cool.  \n\n**Breakdown:**  \n1. **Acknowledge the User’s Question:** Briefly shares a nostalgic scent to build connection, then ties it back to the user’s mention of baking.  \n2. **Link to User’s Activity:** References the oatmeal cookies and the cat, creating continuity.  \n3. **Specific, Gentle Prompt:** Asks about the cat’s name, a simple detail that encourages recall without pressure.  \n4. **Engaging Imagery:** Uses vivid language (“waiting patiently by your porch”) to keep the tone warm and inviting.  \n\nThis approach aligns with the conversation flow, supports memory recall through structured yet natural prompts, and maintains a warm, patient tone.', 'Hi Bob! That’s wonderful to hear. 🌟 Could you tell me about one meal you had today? Maybe lunch—what did you enjoy having? If it’s easier, we can take it step by step. How does that sound?  \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Personalize & Acknowledge:** Use Bob’s name and affirm his positive statement to build rapport.  \n2. **Structured Prompt:** Narrow the focus to a single meal (lunch) to avoid overwhelming him.  \n3. **Gentle Guidance:** Offer to break it down further, giving Bob control over the pace.  \n4. **Open-Ended & Supportive:** Encourage details without pressure, leaving room for partial recall.  \n\nThis approach aligns with the requirements by balancing specificity with flexibility, maintaining warmth, and scaffolding memory support naturally.', '**You’re doing wonderfully! Let’s see if we can connect these pieces.** 🌟  \n\n- **Sandwich fillings**: You mentioned soft bread—maybe with tomato or lettuce. Did it have a spread, like butter or mayo?

Did you eat in the kitchen or somewhere cozy like the living room?  \n\nThis approach balances structure with natural conversation, gently guiding memory without pressure.", 'Those sparrows sure do love mornings in the park! Daffodils sound lovely—they’re such cheerful spring flowers, aren’t they? Maybe the sunshine today made them stand out a bit more.  \n\nAs for breakfast, tea and toast is a classic! Do you usually prefer butter, jam, or a little of both? And don’t worry about finishing your tea—sometimes a cozy sip is all we need. Would you like me to remind you what you’ve mentioned before about your breakfast routine?', 'Hi there! Just checked for you—yes, today’s definitely Tuesday, and it’s still early afternoon. Plenty of time to grab those groceries! Let’s see… bread, milk, and maybe eggs? Do you have a favorite kind of bread you like to get? I remember my grandma always swore by the sourdough from her local bakery.  \n\nOh, and since you thought it might be Wednesday earlier—do you usually have a different routine on Wednesdays? Maybe a weekly visit or activity? Let me know while we sort your list! 😊', 'The way sunlight turns your kitchen into a golden nest sounds absolutely lovely—it’s like the day itself is giving you a warm hug! Since it’s 10:30 AM, maybe your son’s call will arrive just as that blanket of light reaches your favorite chair.

What’s one thing he did that still makes you giggle when you think about it?*  \n- If unsure: *Sometimes the best calls come when we’re least expecting them! Do you have a go-to snack or drink you’ll enjoy while waiting, like a cookie with that comforting tea?*', 'Ah, a haircut sounds lovely! It’s Tuesday morning, and the sun is shining—perfect weather for getting out. Do you remember if your haircut is scheduled for later this morning or the afternoon?

Let’s gently press a finger into the soil—if it feels dry, we can water just a little. If not, the plants can wait patiently. They’re so loved by you!  \n\nYou mentioned your tea earlier—did the cinnamon toast remind you of his laugh, or was it plain today? Either way, I imagine the warmth stayed with you. Oh, and the feeder… after lunch, would you like to add seeds? We could listen for the sparrows’ “thank you” later!  \n\n**Breakdown:**  \n1. **Validates emotion** (sparrows evoke husband’s smile) to honor her memory.  \n2. **Simplifies plant care** (check soil, no urgency) to reduce stress.  \n3. **Connects toast to memory** (cinnamon/his laugh) for gentle recall.  \n4. **Offers optional activity** (refill feeder) with a hopeful twist.  \n\n**Follow-Up Prompts (if needed):**  \n- If cinnamon toast sounds nice tomorrow, I’ll remind you at breakfast—shall I?  \n- The feeder’s looking a bit bare. Would you prefer to fill it together later, or enjoy the quiet garden first?  \n\nThis approach blends reassurance with nostalgic cues, keeping the conversation anchored in comfort and kindness.', 'Yes, it’s Wednesday—though I can see why it might feel like Thursday! Time has a way of slipping by, doesn’t it? Let’s piece this together: Those pink flowers in Mrs. Johnson’s garden sound lovely! Were they clustered near her porch or spread out along the path? And the little dog you saw—I think the one with the fluffy tail and a blue leash is usually Max. Does that match what you remember?  \n\nNow, after your walk, did you pause for a snack or a drink?

I can almost hear the sparrows’ quick chirps matching the rhythm of her song—how lovely that their lively calls keep that memory close! While I can’t hum aloud, I imagine her tune might have been something like *[softly mimics rhythm with words]* “Sparrow, sparrow, where do you fly? Over the hills, where the sun meets the sky…” Does that playful lilt feel familiar, or maybe the way she’d tap her trowel in time?  \n\nThose pink and orange blooms—what a vibrant hug of color! Even without names, their brightness must feel like her hands still guiding yours. And when the rain scent wraps around you, does it ever make you whisper, “Good morning, Mom,” as if she’s tending the soil beside you?  \n\nIf a snippet of the song floats back later, I’d love to hear it.

Or shall we wander down either path together?', 'Aww, you’re making me smile with that kindness—thank you! 🌟 I’m glad the sun is shining for both of us!

If you had toast at the kitchen table, maybe the notebook was nearby? Or if you took the toast outside, perhaps the birds sang while you wrote? (And yes, your roses *are* pink—they look lovely this time of year!) Did any of that feel familiar? We can circle back—whatever sticks out to you!  \n\n*(Gentle structure: Anchors to the confirmed day/weather, ties the notebook to routines, links toast location to sensory cues like birds/roses, and validates his correct recall of the roses’ color. Leaves room for him to guide the next step.)*', 'Hello Bob! Today is Wednesday. Let’s check the calendar—see if it’s nearby! (Pause) You had oatmeal—great choice! Did you pour milk from the red carton? Maybe check the fridge?  \n\n**Follow-Up Structure (if needed):**  \n- **If Bob confirms the day or finds the calendar:**  \n  *Well done, Bob! Now, let’s peek in the fridge together. Is the red milk carton on the top shelf?*  \n- **If he’s unsure about the milk:**  \n  *No worries! Did your oatmeal feel creamy or dry? Sometimes hands remember textures better than words!*  \n- **If he mentions his granddaughter visiting:**  \n  *How special! Did she wear her blue scarf? Look at her photo—see if it jogs your memory!*  \n\nThis uses visual/tactile cues (calendar, fridge, textures) and ties actions to concrete objects, reinforcing recall gently.']
